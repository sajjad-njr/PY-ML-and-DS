At the beginning of 2022, I was no less knowledgeable about the outer world. I thought only competitive programming was the only way to get better jobs. 

I used Twitter to get updated news on Football. I am a football freak. One random day I see  on Twitter a guy name who posts about open sources. I have stuck the word, what are open sources?

By name, we know that open sources mean the source code is open. Nothing more than I know. I started following the man. None other than his is Kunal Kushwaha .

Following his tweet, my interest in open sources going to high . And I was watching videos and read articles to know more about it. The one thing that shocked me is that Kunal did everything before completing his undergraduate. 

I was not interested in development, even though I have no clear idea about DevOps. I live in Bangladesh and my university has no bother about that , they are busy with traditional things .
